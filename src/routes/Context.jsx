                    to a purer 'form', focused on composition, use of typography and materiality. These magazines, gaining
                    popularity in the early 60's rapidly devolved into a mass media source of sensational, shocking,
                    intrusive and erotic articles/stories. <br /><br /> Out of the medium sprung goliaths such as Playboy, Penthouse,
                    High Society, Modern Man and many more. These goliaths are often revered as a combination of

                    Instead it's goal is to extract what graphic progress & experiment was made in this late twentieth century medium.
                    In this extraction, the last step is then to transform the ridded content into topical, contemporary and
                    in our view content of great importance. <br /><br /> In doing so we've been zum gestalt und zurück.</p>
